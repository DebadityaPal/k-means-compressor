# For contributors
## Tech Stack
The entire package has been made using C/C++.
You need to have a GCC compiler with a **version** higher than 10.2.0.
### Windows Users
You can get an updated  version of GCC from [Winlibs](https://winlibs.com/)

## Adding Features
Each feature must be created in a separate header (.hpp) file. The main CLI code is in [compressor.cpp](https://github.com/DebadityaPal/k-means-compressor/blob/ead70947cf5630fd6d786001538600ecdeaba800/compressor.cpp), 
Every time a new feature is added, add the relevant arguments to this file.

## Linter
Currently we are using Intellisense C++ Linter, it should be auto installed for VSCode users if the C/C++ extension has been installed.
